# Set-Data-Structure
An implementation of a generic set in python as well as useful methods that it can implement. The set imports behaviors from t_array which helps draw sets visually to see results of methods called in Set.  NOTE: t_array is not provided, but rather the point is to show the algorithms used to implement the methods Set implements
